SCALING 
horizontal scaling
 - load balancing required
 - consistency required
 - resilient, no single point of failure
 

 sql vs no sql
 - acid+transaction in sql
 - for larger data - logging or analytics
 - sql is vertical scalable, nosql is horizontal
 - graph based data - neo 
 - hierachical/nested data - no sql
 - key value or document based - no sql


 Consistent hashing, Round robin


Plan:
1. requirements
2. decision 
    - scalablity, 
    - availability
    - consistency, cap
    - Caching, Redis for user sessions
    - db Design
    - sharding 
    - partitioning
    - load balancing
    - cdn
    - messaging queue system
    - rate limiting - ddos attack
    - web socket
    - Elastic search
    - security
